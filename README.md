## Features
### 1. Data Acquisition and Updates
- **Real-time Data Acquisition:** Utilize the GitHub REST API to obtain the latest collaboration data within the repository.
- **Continuous Updating:** Support incremental training of the model to adapt to dynamic changes in data, meeting the current application needs of repository maintainers.(feature under development)
### 2. Issue Assignment Task Benchmark
- **Unified Framework:** Implements various models for training and testing under a unified framework using [PyTorch Geometric (PyG)](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric).
- **Module composition:** Includes dataset construction, data loading, and model design tailored for issue assignment tasks.
### 3. Frontend Plugin Functionality
- **Display Recommendations:** Shows recommended developers for the current issue directly within the issue interface.
- **Model Selection:** Allows users to choose from different available models to view various recommendation results.
- **Metric Display:** Show the `Activity` of developers over the **past three months** (weighted exponentially with more recent time having greater weight), average `Community_OpenRank` contribution, and average `Global_OpenRank` influence. This helps repository maintainers make more informed decisions. Refer to the [Opendigger's doc](https://open-digger.cn/en/docs/user_docs/intro) for the meanings of these metrics.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Users can provide feedback on the recommendations using a thumbs-up (approve) or thumbs-down (disapprove). (This project will not be realized. For details, please refer to [Issue-Assigner-BaaS](https://github.com/zhingoll/Issue-Assigner-BaaS).)
### 4. Backend Service Functionality
- **Result Storage:** Stores the recommended results post-model testing for frontend display.
- **Feedback Storage and Evaluation:** Records real user feedback from the frontend and utilizes the [OpenRank](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3639477.3639734) for subsequent model evaluation (feature under development). (This project will not be realized. For details, please refer to [Issue-Assigner-BaaS](https://github.com/zhingoll/Issue-Assigner-BaaS).)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Python:** 3.10.15
- **Torch:** 1.13.1
- **Git:** To clone the repository
- **Node.js and npm:** For frontend development (if you plan to modify the frontend)
- **Browser:** Currently only tested on Edge
- **MongoDB:** 7.0.1
- **Neo4j:** 5.12.0
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhingoll/Issue-Assigner.git
```
### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Getting the Specified Repo Data
First, you need to create a `config.yaml` file in the data folder. Examples are as follows:
```bash
mongodb:
  db: "your_db_name"
  url: "your_db_url"
  tz_aware: true
  uuidRepresentation: "standard"

tokens:
  - "your_token1"
  - "your_token2"
  ...

projects:
  - "owner/name" # The repo name you want to get, such as 'X-lab2017/opendigger'
  ...

neo4j:
  uri: "your_uri"
  username: "your_neo4j_name"
  password: "your_password"

repo: # example
  owner: "X-lab2017" 
  name: "open-digger"  # The name(owner/name) of the repo you want to make into a dataset
```
After creating the `config.yaml` file, run:
```bash
python .\data\repo_data_collect.py 
```
This command will get the data of your specified repo and store them in mongodb.
### Building 'Developer-PR-Issue' Collaboration Graph
Run the following command to import the data stored in mongodb in the previous step into neo4j and build a 'Developer-PR-Issue' collaboration graph.
```bash
python .\data\mongo2neo.py
```
### Generating the Raw Materials to Build the Dataset
Run the following command to generate the raw materials needed for model training datasets. 
```bash
python .\data\issue_content.py
python .\data\neo_mongo2csv.py opendigger
```
Once the script has run, it will automatically create a new folder named after the specified repository within the `dataset` directory. Additionally, within this new folder, the script will also create a subfolder named `raw`. All generated CSV files will be automatically saved in this `raw` folder, thus being immediately ready for use in subsequent model training dataset construction.
Here are specific examples of where the CSV files will be saved. If the repository name specified is "opendigger," then the paths for the saved CSV files will appear as follows:
```bash
dataset\opendigger\raw\user_issue.csv 
dataset\opendigger\raw\open_issues.csv 
dataset\opendigger\raw\resolved_issues.csv 
dataset\opendigger\raw\issue_content.csv
```
### Running the Main Application
Navigate to the project's root directory and run:
```bash
python main.py
```
This command initiates the training and testing of models related to the issue assignment tasks.
### Obtain Metric Data
Run the following command to retrieve the developer `Activity` in a specified repository over the **past three months**, as well as the `Community_OpenRank` contribution and the `Global_OpenRank` value. The `Activity` is calculated using an **exponentially weighted sum**, giving greater weight to more recent activity. Other metrics are calculated as **averages**.
```bash
python .\server\developer_metrics.py
```
### Using the Frontend Plugin
#### 1.Load the Plugin in the Browser
- Open the Edge browser (currently tested only on Edge).
- Enter developer mode by navigating to `edge://extensions/`.
- Enable the **Developer mode** toggle.
- Click on **Load unpacked** and select the `frontend` folder from the project directory.
#### 2.Start the Backend Service
In a new terminal window, navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```
Start the FastAPI service using Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```
#### 3.Interact with the Plugin
As the project is still in the experimental stage, the suggested issue is specified in the file `opened_issues.csv`. The project path example for this file is: `dataset\opendigger\raw\`. You can experience the functionality of the plugin by using the issue number provided in this file. 
- Use the provided interface to **select different models** and view their recommendations.
- Provide **feedback** using the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons. (This project will not be realized. For details, please refer to [Issue-Assigner-BaaS](https://github.com/zhingoll/Issue-Assigner-BaaS).)

## Future Plans
- Model Expansion: Incorporate additional models and algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Browser Compatibility: Extend plugin support to other browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
- Simplify the project use process and make it more convenient for users.
- Feedback Integration: Utilize user feedback combined with the OpenRank algorithm for enhanced model evaluation (feature under development).
